# Prostate Lesion Detection in 3D BI-Parametric MR images

## Brief Summary
The present repository serves as an implementation of diverse 3D deep learning segmentation architectures for the purpose of detecting lesions within the prostate.  
In this study, a collection of datasets obtained from eight clinical centers located in various regions of Europe and three MR vendors (General Electric, Philips, and Siemens) were employed to train distinct models for analysis. Each patient consists of T2-Weighted, ADC and DWI images while the preprocessing of the data performed utilizing te nnU-Net [1] to segment Prostate's Whole gland
